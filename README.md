## CSCI420 Introduction to Computer Graphics
#### Project list:
- HW1: OpenGL's core profile and shader-based programming
	- In this project, I used image data from a grayscale JPEG file to create a height field, such that the two dimensions of the grid correspond to the two dimensions of the image and the height value is a function of the image grayscale level.
- HW2: Simulating a Roller Coaster
	- In this assignment, I used Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL lighting and texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation. The simulation will run in a first-person view, allowing the user to "ride" the coaster in an immersive environment. 

#### Note: only main source code are provided, additional libraries required to run this program are omitted.
